  <h1>The More Loving One</h1>

  <p>Looking up at the stars, I know quite well<br>
  That, for all they care, I can go to hell,<br>
  But on earth indifference is the least<br>
  We have to dread from man or beast.</p>

  <p>How should we like it were stars to burn<br>
  With a passion for us we could not return?<br>
  If equal affection cannot be,<br>
  Let the more loving one be me.</p>

  <p>Admirer as I think I am<br>
  Of stars that do not give a damn,<br>
  I cannot, now I see them, say<br>
  I missed one terribly all day.</p>

  <p>Were all stars to disappear or die,<br>
  I should learn to look at an empty sky<br>
  And feel its total dark sublime,<br>
  Though this might take me a little time.</p>
